Simulation of an airline website where the user can search and buy flight tickets. Built with react and sass. This was my first react project and I used it to learn Its most basic concepts.
Functionalities include:
- The user can search for flight tickets using different variables such as dates, origin/destination and number of tickets.
- The user can look at every ticket available according to the variables selected and select the ones he wants.
